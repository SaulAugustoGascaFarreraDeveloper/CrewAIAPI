Although no visible mold conditions were identified, it is recommended to conduct mold sampling to determine if atypical mold conditions are present. This testing is advised even if suspect conditions are not readily visible.\n- The EPA recommends testing all homes for radon levels, as radon gas is the number one cause of mortality in homes.\n\nGiven these findings, I would like to request a quote for the following services:\n1. Mold sampling and analysis to be conducted by an AIHA certified laboratory.\n2. Radon level testing throughout the property.\n\nAdditionally, I would appreciate it if you could provide an action plan detailing the steps required to address any issues identified through these tests.\n\nYour timely response to this request will be greatly appreciated as we aim to ensure the safety and well-being of the future occupants of this property.\n\nThank you in advance for your cooperation and prompt attention to this matter.\n\nBest regards,\n\nBrandon Hancock,\nHancock Realty",
